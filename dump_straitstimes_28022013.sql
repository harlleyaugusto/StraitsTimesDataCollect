However, most of what you said don\'t make sense. \nRedneck Loo \nThere are strict labour laws in Europe and America governing strikes, and its always a last resort after all negotiations have broken down before the employees go on strike. Unless you have first hand knowledge, you really sounded hollow calling workers from those areas \"white trash\" (and by the way, Europe and American are a lot more cosmopolitan than you think). These PRC workers have a contract with SMRT, and what they have done is a breach of contract, and also collectively a violation of the labour law in Singapore. This is no comparison with the strikes you see in Europe and America.\nWith regards to the ability to speaking other languages, unless it is a skill related to the job, or specified as a job requirement, it would be discriminatory to pay the worker who speaks other languages more than one who does not. I have no reason to believe that SMRT has such discriminatory pay policies. What happens typically in Singapore is to pay per demand and supply. SMRT probably went to China or through labour brokers, offer a contract with specified wages and benefits. They accepted as those are better than what they have at home. SMRT went to the Malaysians and offer something different that commensurate with a higher cost of living there. Two contracts for the same job but different wages - that\'s a sure thing for unhappiness. \nNow, at your so called land of \"white trash\", where I happened to have worked at, foreign workers are paid the same wages as local employees. It protects the local people from hiring foreigners cheaper at the expense of local employment, and at the same time protects legitimate foreign hires from unfair treatment. That, to me, is what\'s missing in the Singapore labor laws.\nI used to have a foreign domestic worker, but no more. I just cannot accept the fact that they are paid $300 - 400, working over 200 hours a month. For everyone here criticising foreign workers situation in Singapore, how many of you don\'t have a domestic worker at your home?\nAnyway, I am not siding with the PRC strikers.

You do not have system assurance specialist in your SMRT unlike the LTA which has a SA & I Dept. You need their help to relook the old lines holistically otherwise you will have intermittent problems affecting your revenue service.\nAnother area you may want to pay attention to is the system-wide new signalling upgrading (from fixed block to CBTC system) project may even cause you a lot of interfacing problems if the LTA is not alert or aware of the hazards to your current revenue operation.\nHope this helps.
